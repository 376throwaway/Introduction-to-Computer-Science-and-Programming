# Cmpt 120 final project
Planets vs Aliens Game:
- Worked together with a team of two on building a Python planets and alien game application that allows the user to customize their planet settings and collect rock specimens with aliens 
- Programmed the data system by using strings and lists so the user has access to the fuel levels, rock specimens, alien stats and have the correct planet position displayed
- Coded the visuals using pythons builtin **turtle** feature, to enhance gaming experience and immersion 
- Conducted final debugging tests by trial and error to ensure the data system is functioning correctly without input or display errors
