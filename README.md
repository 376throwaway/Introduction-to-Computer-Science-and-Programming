# Planets-vs-Aliens
Cmpt 120 final project:
- Worked together with a team of two on building a Python planets and alien game application that allows the user to customize their planet settings and collect rock specimens with aliens 
-	Programmed the data system by using strings and lists so the user has access to the fuel levels, rock specimens, alien stats and have the correct planet position displayed
-	Conducted final debugging tests by trial and error to ensure the data system is functioning correctly without input or display errors
